## Features
- Create 3D models using JavaScript code
- Built-in examples (gear, vase, spiral, bracket)
- Export models as STL files
- Debug mode to visualize geometry edges
- Slice preview to inspect cross-sections
- Measurement tools for distances
- Real-time model statistics

## Usage
1. Write or modify code in the editor panel
2. Click "Run" to generate the 3D model
3. Use mouse to rotate/zoom the view
4. Export as STL when ready

## Controls
- Left-click + drag: Rotate view
- Mouse wheel: Zoom in/out
- Arrow keys: Change views
- Right-click: Cancel measurement


This was just a fun little experiment!
